# Portfolio 2024

This portfolio was created to have a digital CV and a give some insight into who I am as a developer.

## Challenge

I like to challenge myself, I also find "Going back to the Basics" as a valuable mantra, as every great building, project, endeavour etc. have a solid foundation.

Therefore I set a couple of challenges or restraints for myself creating this portfolio:
1. Plain HTML, CSS, Javscript Only
2. As little HTML as possible


## Findings

The strength of the big javscript frontend libs are great. But for a small project like this, it is absolutely overkill. 

A pro-framework insight. The big frameworks have a broad acceptence of what best practises to use. This will give an easy handoverprocess to even small projects. as an example in this project i written most code without structuring javascript in several files, which results in one big javascript file that is hard to understand at a glance.

A con-framework insight. Scaffolding and setting up several libs to work together like adding tailwind, typescript, nextJS, unit testing etc. takes time. With a good grasp of the basic concepts speed is on you side when creating small MVPs. This project took some extra time for me because of my self emplied restraints, but actually using HTML as it is intended would have made this small project very fast to set up.

## Take aways

- know why you are using which framework
- know the strengths of a framework before emplementing
- know the purpose of you project (MVP, scalable production app etc.)
